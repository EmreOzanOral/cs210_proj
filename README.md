*First of all, Hello There!*

I uploaded source .json files as well // they are named {1-10}.json

There is a presentation in pdf format and you should start with the presentation to get the general idea. 

In my code there are commented sections which I did experimenting and there are 2 code pieces which I very liked personally, it uses Spotify API to create playlists for you. //Top 200 of all time 
These playlists are based on total listening time which I like but some songs which are longer benefit from this algorithm more.

This API usage could be improved and I am very intrigued. I will definitely use it with my Spotify data.

I also uploaded .csv files which I gathered from Chosic like in first homework of this semestre. I used the "my all time top 1000" playlist which I also explain in my presentation.

I research how my all time favourites represent my music taste based on those songs' Popularity values. For example I pick popular songs based on their Happy value (makes me happy). In my case based on my tests (which I did almost all of them but the Spearson is valid one) I prefer popular songs with Loud and Dance values high.

*Hope you will like my research. Have a nice day to you all.*
